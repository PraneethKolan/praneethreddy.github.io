								<h2 class="major"><center>Annotated Summary</center></h2>
									<p>Fish life span is more dependent on their feed and the condition of the water. The more we look after the more days they live. Unfortunately, fishes die the most compared to any other pets. To overcome this problem, authors have discovered a solution using the Internet of Things. Using microcontrollers, pH sensors, and a servo motor they invented a system to look after the feeding and water quality from time to time even without human assistance. The authors underwent a few phases and tested the working of the system. Thus, they got recognized by the IR4.0 system which is a development system supporting fishes. 
									The system consists of two microcontrollers controlled by a WIFI module. The pH sensor and servo motor for feeding are connected to controllers. Lastly connecting them to the internet and the BLYNK application through which users can monitor the condition of fish and water.
									As a part of testing, the authors tested in three phases. In the first two phases, they haven’t used a filter for water filtration and fed the fish twice and thrice a day as 2 sets of feeding. Followed by without filter in the next two phases. In the last two phases also fed the fish twice and thrice per day. The phases analysis came out very helpful. Feeding the fish over leads to acidic water and the same for water without a filter. So they concluded to feed the fish twice a day with good filtration along with temperature settings.
									
									<center>Critique The Article</center>
									This article is an IEEE research paper that is reputable and the system mentioned in this paper is certified by the fish development system as IR4.0. By this, we can say that it is reputable. 
									This research topic is helpful for me as I have been working on sensors from my undergraduate projects. pH sensor using LCD indicator is new to know. Hopefully, I will remember this and work on it using in my new projects.

											This article conveys a systematic review to find the survival rate among oral cancer patients using artificial intelligence. The forms of the results are used with machine learning methods. Article studies show that only a 5-year survival rate is able to predict by AI models. The accuracy of the machine learning methods- decision tree classifier, logistic regression, and boosted decision tree models were 76%, 60%, and 88.7%, respectively. This article is published recently in EBSCO. These studies are important for identification and survival prediction, which will contribute to future advancements, change in the treatment plan, and reduce healthcare problems.

								Schlinger, R. (2014). APPLICANT TRACKING SYSTEMS How to Navigate the ATS 
								<p class="hangingindent">
									Resume-Writing Landscape. Career Planning & Adult Development Journal, 30(2), 164–175.
									<p class="hangingindent">
										The article explores the environment of resume writing for applicant tracking systems (ATS) in 2014. The definition of ATS technology, how it can discover candidates and match them with job criteria, and how it makes it easier to report hiring data to the federal government are all discussed in the course material. The workings of ATS and numerous ATS-related myths and truths are also covered. Resumes were sent, opened, and read by humans before the Internet and online apps. Today, applicant tracking systems (ATS) initially examine upwards of 80% of resumes (ATS). A resume is unlikely to ever be read by a human person if it fails to meet the ATS requirements. To be taken into consideration for a job at many organizations, a resume must also pass the ATS requirements even if it is read by a human. The "black hole" of ATS frustrates most job seekers since their resumes vanish there. As career experts, we can best assist our clients by guiding them through the ATS so they may succeed.

									<p class="hangingindent">
										ATS, which stands for applicant tracking system, is a typical technology used by recruiters during the hiring process. In essence, it's a database that organizes candidate data to manage each stage of the hiring process. At Sullivan Consulting, we employ ATS software to facilitate efficient operations. We can trace each candidate's progress through the various steps, such as first- and second-round interviews through reference and qualification checks, by viewing candidates alongside the jobs they have applied for. For us, using ATS software is a practical method to manage the hiring process so that we can give each candidate a satisfying hiring experience.
								 <p class="hangingindent">
									Software for applicant tracking systems is created to make it easier for employers and recruiters to manage client and candidate data in one place. Integrations with calendars, time sheets, salary information, job boards, etc. are typical. Some organizations utilize its semi-sophisticated AI to match applicants to job listings, but we think the technology still needs improvement before it can be effective in this capacity. Our company uses ATS.

										The article discusses how computerized application tracking systems (ATS) are becoming more common in the job search process and how clients and career counselors need to be aware of its effects as of 2014. The advantages of ATS in connecting businesses with eligible passive job prospects and its greatest application in the small business sector are among the subjects covered. The advantages of resume durability and taking into account various job openings provided by ATS to job searchers are also mentioned.
